DESCRIPTION:
The index.ts file implements a Cloudflare Worker that serves as an API endpoint for analyzing preworkout supplement labels using Google's Gemini AI model. Here's what it does:

1. Receives POST requests containing base64-encoded images of supplement labels
2. Sends these images to the Gemini API along with a detailed prompt for analysis
3. Processes the response to extract:
   - Detailed ingredient information (name, quantity, and effects)
   - Ratings for different qualities (pump, energy, focus, recovery, endurance)
4. Returns the analyzed data as a structured JSON response

The API is designed to be simple to use while providing comprehensive supplement analysis through AI.

RETURNED DATA STRUCTURE:
The API returns a JSON object with the following structure:

{
    "ingredients": [
        {
            "name": "Ingredient Name",        // e.g., "Caffeine Anhydrous"
            "quantity": "Amount with Units",  // e.g., "300mg"
            "effects": [                      // Array of detailed effect descriptions
                "Increases alertness and reduces fatigue",
                "Improves focus and reaction time"
            ]
        }
        // ... more ingredients
    ],
    "qualities": {
        "pump": 85,        // Rating from 1-100 for muscle blood flow
        "energy": 90,      // Rating from 1-100 for stimulant effects
        "focus": 75,       // Rating from 1-100 for mental clarity
        "recovery": 60,    // Rating from 1-100 for muscle recovery
        "endurance": 70    // Rating from 1-100 for stamina
    }
}

Frontend Design Considerations:
1. Ingredients List:
   - Display each ingredient in a card or list item
   - Show quantity prominently
   - Effects can be shown in an expandable section or tooltip
   - Consider grouping ingredients by primary purpose (stimulants, pump enhancers, etc.)

2. Quality Ratings:
   - Visualize ratings using progress bars, radar charts, or circular gauges
   - Use consistent color coding (e.g., red for energy, blue for pump)
   - Consider adding visual indicators for "good" (>75), "moderate" (40-75), and "low" (<40) ratings
   - Tooltips can explain what each quality represents

3. Error Handling:
   - Handle cases where the API returns an error (status 400 or 500)
   - Show appropriate loading states while the image is being analyzed
   - Provide feedback if the image upload fails

IMPLMENETATION:

Frontend to Backend:
The frontend needs to send a POST request to this API
The image should be converted to a base64 string
The request body should be JSON with format: { "image": "base64StringHere" }
Common Frontend Implementation Steps:
When a user selects an image (e.g., through a file input or drag & drop)
Use FileReader to convert the image to base64
Remove the "data:image/jpeg;base64," prefix if it exists
Send the base64 string in a POST request to your API

What the Backend Does:
Receives the base64 string
Embeds it in the Gemini API request along with the prompt
Returns the analyzed supplement data as JSON
The main thing to note is that the image must be properly base64 encoded when it reaches the backend, as that's what the Gemini API expects in its inlineData format.
